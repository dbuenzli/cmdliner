[Cmdliner] provides a simple and compositional mechanism
to convert command line arguments to OCaml values and pass them to
your functions.

The library automatically handles syntax errors, help messages and
UNIX man page generation. It supports programs with single or multiple
commands (like [git]) and respect most of the
{{:http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap12.html}
POSIX} and

GNU} conventions.
